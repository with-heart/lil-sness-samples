 ===================
 || WHAT IS THIS? ||
 ===================

Lil'Sness is an original SNES-like soundfont, meaning no samples were taken from any existing SNES games.
Each sample was recorded and processed within the constraints of the SNES's sound hardware, to make them as authentic-sounding as possible.
Most samples were taken from 80s and 90s sound libraries, much like programmers/composers did back in the day.
It contains over 160 samples to choose from, all organised in the general midi format.

This release contains both a soundfont with all the samples, and a pack of individual wav files, for use in trackers!
(or if you don't have a soundfont player)

If you do use this soundfont for a song or video game, I'd love to know about it!
